	<p>Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation, aiming to produce synchronized and realistic sound effects for silent videos, is widely applied in video editing, sound effect creation and autonomous content enhancement. Existing V2A methods have succeeded in generating fixed-length, short audios.However, generating audio for variable-length, long-form videos in practical applications remains a significant challenge.These challenges highlight the need for more flexible V2A models that can effectively handle the long-form input videos, as well as a well-established benchmark for long-form V2A generation.</p>
